# Welcome to My First Repository

Hi there! I'm Saara, and I'm on a journey to become a Data Engineer. 
I have a background in communications, but I'm diving headfirst into the world of data engineering. 
This repo is where I'll be sharing my progress as I learn the basics and take on new challenges. 

Feel free to follow along, give me pointers, or just see what I'm up to. 

Thanks for stopping by!
