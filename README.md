# Welcome to My Learning Repository

Hi there! I'm Saara, and I'm on a journey to become a Data Engineer. I have a background in communications, but I'm diving headfirst into the world of data engineering. This repo is where I'll be sharing my progress as I learn the basics and take on new challenges.

Feel free to follow along, give me pointers, or just see what I'm up to. Thanks for stopping by!

## Recent Updates
- Added `hello_world.py` script that prints "Hello, world!"
- Created a branch `feature-hello-world`, made changes, and successfully merged it into the `main` branch.

## Data Pipeline Project
This section outlines the components of a simple data pipeline that I'm building as part of my learning process.

### Project Structure
- `scripts/`: Contains Python scripts for data ingestion, cleaning, and analysis.
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed data files.
- `docs/`: Contains documentation related to the project.

### Goals
1. **Data Ingestion:** Fetch data from an external source.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Clean and preprocess the ingested data.
3. **Data Analysis:** Analyze the cleaned data and generate insights.

## Next Steps
- Implement the data ingestion script.
- Implement the data cleaning script.
- Implement the data analysis script.
